LIKE 
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

•	 The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
•	 The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character


SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column name LIKE pattern;
Example – 
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE FN LIKE ‘a%’-----Finds any values that start with "a"
WHERE FN LIKE ‘%a’ ------- Finds any values that end with "a"
WHERE FN LIKE ‘_r’---Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE FN LIKE ‘a_’-----------Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'  -------------start with “a” & end with “o”
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';


18.	 INSERT INTO 
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table _ or new row into table 
Specify both the column names and the values & insert
1.
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
2.
 If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query.
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

19.	 UPDATE 

The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
UPDATE table_name
SET column name = ‘value1’, column name = ‘value2’
WHERE column name = value;


20.	DELETE

The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE column name = ‘value’;

21.	ALIAS 

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
Used to make changes column headings

SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

22.	SELECT INTO
The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table or other table 
Used to create a table from an existing table by copying the existing table's columns
SELECT column name
INTO newtable 
FROM oldtable

23.	UNION 
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
•	Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
•	The columns must also have similar data types
•	The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

UNION Syntax

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

UNION ALL Syntax

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

UNION VS UNIONALL
Removes duplicate values,
Allow duplicate values

SQL Constraint Used in SQL 
It is used limit data type
Constraints can be specified when the table is created
Used to specify rules for data in table
Constrain should be at column level or table level
Column level constraint apply to column level & table level constraint apply to table level
